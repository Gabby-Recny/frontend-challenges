## ABSTRACT (WHAT, HOW, WHY)
My rendition of Tic Tac Toe was prompted by a challenge posed by my team lead to build upon our React.Js knowledge. The application features a fully responsive and interactive interface styled with CSS and utilizes local storage to store score information. When entering the application, the players are brought to a landing page where they can choose their tokens. When starting the game, the players alternate are brought to a new page using React Router where they beging to play the game. The players take turns and choose the space they wish to fill with their game token. When a game is won or if there is a draw, the game status changes and the scores are tracked until the players choose 'Quit Game' when the scores are cleared. The players are also equipped to restart the game at any point.
